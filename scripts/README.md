The Gaussian and lognormal maps (in .fits format) have not been included in the repository (due to their large sizes)

One can easily recreate them using the scripts:

gaussian_map_producer.sh (requires the software healpy : https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/# )

lognormal_map_producer.sh (requires the software Flask : http://www.astro.iag.usp.br/~flask/ )
